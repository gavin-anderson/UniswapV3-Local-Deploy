npx hardhat node //in terminal 1
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/01_deployContracts.js
```
Copy outputs and paste necessary parts into 03,04,05,06, and check files.
rest of npm commands can be found at end of main function in every file. 

Changes to be made, no more copy-paste just file read and write, update packages to reflect newer dependecies. Bytecode will fail if not "@uniswap/v3-periphery": "1.2.1" 
Also change the approvals.
